# Portfolio-Content
Programmer
Create the content for our Personal Portfolio using only HTML. Our portfolio should talk about who we are and list some of our favorite projects, hobbies, our favorite things like sports, our favorite tv show, etc. Our portfolio can look however you want it to look, but the HTML document should use as many of the following tags as we can:

HTML
head, title, meta description,
body, div, a, p, h1, ul, li, table, tr, th, td
